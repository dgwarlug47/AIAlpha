!everywhere on this code, validation means test and test means validation.

If this is the first time using this code, go to the requirements.txt in this
same directory and make every single one of the installations.

Then our first stop it is at the Data2 directory, specifically at the file
new_build_momentum_features.py, remember to configure it before you run it.
in case you don't have data, or wants to use the same data that I did then get
the data through get_data.py or get_data.ipynb they shoudd be the same code

Next thing you should do is to configure your suit.py, this file should be in the
the above directory, in case you do not how to do that, then take a look at the files
at this directory called info.txt, hyper_parameters.txt, and in the Suits directory
there should be the default_suit.py in case you want basic and auto_suit.py in case
results more automatic. After you confiuge the suit you want,
make the command python optuna_experiment_creation.py at the above directory

After the experiment is done, go to the directory Performance_analysis, configure the file
ensemble_creator.py according to your needs and then run it. Now simply go to the place where
you created an ensemble, and there you go.
